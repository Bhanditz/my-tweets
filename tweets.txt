@Tzrlk You would have to read a fairly large survey of his work to grok the method, as I don't think he ever *actually* explains it; I have not found anything of his that I have actually liked yet, either - hence my surprise at the usefulness of his method; it is kind of like a bizzarro world version of Hegel mixed with Marx. Much like Wittgenstein, or any of the philosophers who are really grappling with hard stuff, the method only becomes easily visible years later. I would recommend Delueze before Žižek, and Wittgenstein before Delueze, and De Saussure before Wittgenstein, and Kant before De Sassure, and Plato before Kant on this topic; there is a lot of assumed knowledge before you can really start grappling with something that might let you grapple with the Outer Darkness in any useful way. As such, it is kind of difficult to talk about what the Outer Darkness is in any concise, tweetable way.

My current problem with Ayn Rand, in short rant form: in philosophy, there is actually a literature going back thousands of years. For any kind of theory (eg of ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, even logic) there are a large set of questions and problems that you have to have a good answer for, or at least a good story about how you might get a good answer for them; if you don't, then your theory is just a curiosity that every actual philosopher knows is totally bullshit. The philosophers that students of philosophy regard as Great Philosophers, the ones who have their own schools of thought that lots of people actually study and respect are the ones who managed to formulate a set of theories of many of these kinds which interlocked, and where each of the constituent theories answered their respective sets of questions as they stood at the time, and managed to stand up to new questions for a while. Ayn Rand basically just ignored or misunderstood the literature, and dismissed the questions or answered them in a way that is trivially wrong. Her edifice of theory, Objectivism, is roughly an interlocking set of moral, ethical, aesthetic, ontological, epistemological, logical and metaphysical theories, which cannot stand alone as written. So, she has a lot of surface area to defend, but as the theories interlock in this way, a knock down argument against one is a knock down against all, unless a proponent of Objectivism violates one of the tenants of Objectivism by carving the theories apart into things that would stand alone. Given that, one does not even need to use a new argument to completely discredit Rand and Objectivism; this is what makes me furious about the whole thing. The tiniest smidgin of actual philosophical education would have people laughing at Objectivism as absurd nonsense, rather than believing any of it at all. So, let us take one old problem in Epistemology, namely that of justification of knowledge of the epistemology in question; this is a really basic part of the whole 'groundedness' set of problems. In Objectivism, to use an unbiased summary from an avowed Objectivist, 'Man's consciousness must acquire knowledge of reality by certain means (reason) in accordance to rules (logic/science). Reason is man's only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.' So, the only justified means of acquiring knowledge, including about theories of epistemology, and including specifically about Reason and Science, is through Reason and Science. There is no clause for bootstrapping your knowledge, no clause about being *taught* Reason and Science, because how can you be taught justified true knowledge without your own use of Reason and Science if you do not yet have Reason and Science and knowledge that does not come through your use of Reason and Science is not justified, and claims that Reason and Science are innate are firstly matters of fact which can be tested, and have been tested, and turn out to not be true for any meaningful understanding of what Reason and Science are, and secondly would render Reason and Science to be unjustified by Reason and Science, as you are not discovering them in the world through use of Reason and Science, unless they are taken to be self justifying, which again they are not under any meaningful definitions of the terms. Knock down argument; so, her theory of epistemology is totally bunk. To add insult to injury, Rand does not seem to be familiar with the literature in the fields of Philosophy of Logic and Philosophy of Science, yet takes Reason and Science as foundational without even having a theory which solves (for example) the Problem of Induction, a really basic problem in the field that all (real) theories of this sort have an answer for or an explanation of... So, Objectivism is wrong. And there are many more attacks that are perfect knockdowns on every one of her theories, just in the basic literature about each of these kinds of theory alone. And thus my problem: Ayn Rand knew basically nothing about philosophy, and did not do any research, and declared herself to be the supreme expert on philosophy, and had the skill of convincing gullible, uneducated people that she was the supreme expert, and so I keep seeing Objectivist idiocy treated by uneducated fools as if it were in some way equal or superior to all the actual philosophy that has ever been produced, when even availing oneself of a cursory understanding of any of the fields of philosophy that Ayn Rand claimed as part of Objectivism would reveal that she was just flat wrong.

Obvious realisation is obvious. My path to Omega is all to do with successive approximations towards an exemplar of a given paradigm ordered by when a feature becomes personal Blub; paradigm is what ensures that programming languages ordered by power are a poset, and necessity for folding is the current highest level of Blub I can see. Current best approximations of an archetype of a paradigm: Ioke for Smalltalk, Arc for Lisp, Factor for Forth, maybe K for APL? Not sure what for Prolog; would welcome suggestions about any I have missed. #programming #crazy #blub #omega
